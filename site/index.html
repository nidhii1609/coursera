		First Come First Serve Scheduling Algorithm is one of the simplest scheduling algorithms also known as First In First Out(FIFO). It simple queues the processes in the order that they arrive in the ready queue. In this,the process that comes first will be executed first and the next one will be executed when the previous one gets fully executed. Here we will basically calculate t parameters using FCFS i.e. Average Waiting Time and Average Turnaround Time.
